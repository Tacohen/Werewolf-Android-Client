Werewolf-Android-Client
=======================
A client application for the Mafi-style location-based social game Werewolf. It is designed to interface with the "Werewolf-Server-Java" implementation (open-source and on my Github).

This Android app uses James Smith's Android Asynchronous Http Client (https://github.com/loopj/android-async-http), for which I am very grateful.
